  <p>Hi Dr Lee!

First of all you are a GODSEND because without you we would be hopeless stats students.. The way you teach is so easy to relate to and I feel like you break down such complex things down to abcs for us which has helped us more than you can imagine.
Thank you so much for being so patient with us and always going the extra mile to make things easier for us! Any student is lucky to have you as their tutor! Thank you for everything through the years! Hope to meet your cats someday! üòõüòö</p>
